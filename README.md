**Project Pitch:**

Our project, meant to act as an AI-Powered Personal Scheduler & Tutor, leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help students effectively manage their study schedules and enhance their understanding of course materials. By allowing users to upload PDFs of class notes, textbooks, and syllabus, along with their academic calendar. Using RAG-based AI, the tutor can answer subject-specific queries, summarize key concepts, and help prepare for quizzes. This intelligent assistant ensures students stay organized, maximize their learning efficiency, and receive accurate, context-aware academic support.
